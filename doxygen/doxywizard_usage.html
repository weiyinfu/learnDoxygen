  <h1><a class="anchor" name="doxywizard_usage">Doxywizard usage</a></h1>Doxywizard is a GUI front-end for creating and editing configuration files that are used by doxygen.
  <p> Doxywizard consists of a single executable that, when started, pops up a window.</p>
  <p> The main window has a number of tab field, one for each section in the configuration file. Each tab-field contains a number of lines, one for each configuration option in that section.</p>
  <p> The kind of input widget depends on the type of the configuration option. </p>
  <ul> 
   <li> For each boolean option (those options that are answered with YES or NO in the configuration file) there is a check-box. </li> 
   <li> For items taking one of a fixed set of values (like <a class="el" href="config.html#cfg_output_language.html">OUTPUT_LANGUAGE</a>) a combo box is used. </li> 
   <li> For items taking an integer value from a range, a spinbox is used. </li> 
   <li> For free form string-type options there is a one line edit field </li> 
   <li> For options taking a lists of strings, a one line edit field is available, with a `+' button to add this string to the list and a `-' button to remove the selected string from the list. There is also a button with a circular "refresh" arrow that, when pressed, replaces the selected item in the list with the string entered in the edit field. </li> 
   <li> For file and folder entries, there are special buttons that start a file dialog. </li> 
  </ul>
